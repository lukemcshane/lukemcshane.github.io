Welcome! I am Luke McShane, and I wear a few different hats.

A chess grandmaster since the age of 16, I am sometimes dubbed the 'World's Strongest Amateur'.	

My degree was in Maths and Philosophy at University College, Oxford.

I have worked for several years at investment banks and funds, with experience in currencies and commodities. 

Currently I am excited by the prospects for digital currencies, and am working on some projects in that direction.  

I live on London, a city I love very much.
